This is a Power BI project. The dataset used in this project contains the opinions of a few Data Professionals across the world.
--------
The .pbix file is the Power BI file of the Project and the .png file is the image of the Project.

This dataset contains a few features pertaining to the Data Professionals across the globe, their favorite programming language, Work & Life balance, etc... Let's try and visualize a few of these variables.

Towards the top right, we see two banners indicating the total number of survey takers and their average age.

Starting from the top left, we see a few visualizations. In the form of a TreeMap we see the maximum number of voters per country. Then we see a bar chart showing the average salary of various Data Professionals. 

On the bottom left, we see a column chart of the favorite programming languages of the Data Professionals, then we see with a pie-chart the difficulty to get into a related job.

Finally, at the bottom right, we see two gauges. Representing the Work & Life balance and the satisfaction of the Data Professionals with their compensation.

Thank you!
